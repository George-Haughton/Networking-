# Networking

## Benefits and constraints of network types and standards

### Peer-based
A peer-to-peer network is created when two or more PCs are connected and share resources without going through a different/seperate server computer. On peer-to-peer networks each computer in theory is the same and can communicate with any computer on its network, to which it has been granted to. By contrast, every computer on a peer-to-peer network can be used as a client as-well as a server, in simple terms any system/computer on a peer-to-peer network can be used/seen as a server if it shares a drive, a folder, a printer or some other resource with the rest of the network. Most networks main purpose is to share recources such as backup systems, input devices, dedicated servers and printers. Additionally, networks can help with the sharing of data such as files, emails and other various types of data. Peer-based networking has both disadvantages and advantages that need to be taken into account. A few advantages would be that it is very easy to set up, there is no need for a dedicated server as all nodes (computer) act as a server as well as a client and finally as well as it being easy to set up it is also very inexpensive. Resource sharing and its implications are a huge part of networking. A few examples of peer-to-peer resource/information sharing software include things like: BitTorrent, Spotify and Skype. Peer-to-peer technology allows client computers on the same network to share their own resources such as filestone, processing power and peripherals. When it comes to traditional computer systems the resources are placed on a centrally-managed server, which can be accessed by client machines that are connected to the central server, also knows as a 'client server'. A constraint/disadvantage of peer-to-peer software is that most applications dont give the user much control over how their bandwidth is used. Communicating within peer-to-peer networking is exceptionally easy, as peer-to-peer networking can be seen as a democracy, as each computer is seen as equal to the next and each PC can communicate with the next directly and do not have a main/centralized computer monitoring and/or controlling the communication on the network. The security and working practise of peer-to-peer networking are if a PC is connected to a peer based network then there is the chance that another PC on the home network will access files that the owner might not want to be accessed. Althought his might be the case Windows provides the ability to block access to certain drives. peer-to-peer based networks are perfect for group work or businesses where everyones work needs to be shared or ideas need to be shared around. In a business environment when projects need to have alot of work put into them and there is not time to email and exchnage information; it is more effective for the project and the business if members of the business can access any information needed within seconds. This can improve a businesses productivity and effectiveness. Collaboration within peer-to-peer works in a way which can get everyone involved. There are a few programs that offer peer-to-peer collaboration. For example when colaborating it will start off with a Peer determining the identiity of a peer who is interested in hosting a collaboration session. Next a request to host a session is sent and the host peer agrees to manage collaboration activity. The host will then invite contacts to a session which includes the requestor. The host peer may add remote peers to its contact manager. It also looks at all invitations sent and recieved, to see who has accepted, declined or just not answered. It may cancel invitations for those who have not answered. Now everyone is in and ready the host can start the collaboration session of  the game, bulletpin board, conference or other activity.

### Client server
This is a computer network where there is one main/centralized which is connected to a hub to which many less powerful/important computers/systems are connected called clients, the clients will run progrms and access data that has previously been stored on the server (the main computer). A few advantages of using Client server networks is the fact you have a lot of scalability as you can increase the capacity of clients and servers; any elements can be increased. Communications within A Client server network is different compared to a peer-to-peer network as unlike the peer-to-peer network instead of every computer interacting with each other, the clients (computers) will send requests to the server (main PC), the server will handle them by either completing the request or not completing it, then finally the server will send back the information. Additionally, another communication method within Client server is the RPC which stands for Remote Procedure calls which is a high level communication method, and it was designed to mimic procedure call mechanism but executing it over a network. The working practise for Client server can be seen as the fact the security of the using the Client server network is a lot higher than say peer-to-peer networking because within Client server networking there is one main server (PC) that controls and has more power over every other node (computer). the commercial opportunity/use of Client server networking can be used within a business where there are lots of emplyees using lots of computers. For example within most companies they will have a tech administrator depending on the size of the business This administrator will supervise the whole businesses computer throughout the day and control block, allow and deny what the employees can access and not access. Of course the administrator will have the server computer with the most power, where the employees with be the ones that dont have much control over access and things of this variety.
