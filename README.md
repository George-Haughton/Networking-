# Networking

## Benefits and constraints of network types and standards

### Peer-based
A peer-to-peer network is created when to or more PCs are connected and share resources without goign through a different/seperate server computer. On peer-to-peer networks each computer in theory is the same and can communicate with any computer on its network, to which it has been granted to. By contrast, every computer on a peer-to-peer network can be used as a client as-well as a server, in simple terms any system/computer on a peer-to-peer network can be used/seen as a server if it shares a drive, a folder, a printer or some other resource with the rest of the network. Most networks main purpose is to share recources such as backup systems, input devices, dedicated servers and printers. Additionally, networks can help with the sharing of data such as files, emails and other various types of data. Peer-based networking has both disadvantages and advantages that need to be taken into account. A few advantages would be that it is very easy to set up, there is no need for a dedicated server as all nodes act as a server as well as a client and finally as well as it being easy to set up it is also very inexpensive. Resource sharing and its implications are a huge part of networking. A few examples of peer-to-peer resource sharing software include things like: BitTorrent, Spotify and Skype. Peer-to-peer technology allows client computers on the same network to share their own resources such as filestone, processing power and peripherals. When it comes to traditional computer systems the resources are placed on a centrally-managed server, which can be accessed by client machines that are connected to the central server, also knows as a 'client server'. A constraint/disadvantage of peer-to-peer software is that most applications dont give the user much control over how their bandwidth is used. Communicating within peer-to-peer networking is exceptionally easy, as peer-to-peer networking can be seen as a democracy, as each computer is seen as equal to the next and each PC can communicate with the next directly and do not have a main/centralized computer monitoring and/or controlling the communication on the network. The security and working practise of peer-to-peer networking are if a PC is connected to a peer based network then there is the chance that another PC on the home network will access files that the owner might not want to be accessed. Althought his might be the case Windows provides the ability to block access to certain drives. peer-to-peer based networks are perfect for group work or businesses where everyones work needs to be shared or ideas need to be shared around. In a business environment when projects need to have alot of work put into them and there is not time to email and exchnage information; it is more effective for the project and the business if members of the business can access any information needed within seconds. This can improve a businesses productivity and effectivness.
