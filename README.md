# Networking

## Benefits and constraints of network types and standards

### Peer-based
A peer-to-peer network is created when two or more PCs are connected and share resources without going through a different/seperate server computer. On peer-to-peer networks each computer in theory is the same and can communicate with any computer on its network, to which it has been granted to. By contrast, every computer on a peer-to-peer network can be used as a client as-well as a server, in simple terms any system/computer on a peer-to-peer network can be used/seen as a server if it shares a drive, a folder, a printer or some other resource with the rest of the network. Most networks main purpose is to share recources such as backup systems, input devices, dedicated servers and printers. Additionally, networks can help with the sharing of data such as files, emails and other various types of data. Peer-based networking has both disadvantages and advantages that need to be taken into account. A few advantages would be that it is very easy to set up, there is no need for a dedicated server as all nodes (computer) act as a server as well as a client and finally as well as it being easy to set up it is also very inexpensive. Resource sharing and its implications are a huge part of networking. A few examples of peer-to-peer resource/information sharing software include things like: BitTorrent, Spotify and Skype. Peer-to-peer technology allows client computers on the same network to share their own resources such as filestone, processing power and peripherals. When it comes to traditional computer systems the resources are placed on a centrally-managed server, which can be accessed by client machines that are connected to the central server, also knows as a 'client server'. A constraint/disadvantage of peer-to-peer software is that most applications dont give the user much control over how their bandwidth is used. Communicating within peer-to-peer networking is exceptionally easy, as peer-to-peer networking can be seen as a democracy, as each computer is seen as equal to the next and each PC can communicate with the next directly and do not have a main/centralized computer monitoring and/or controlling the communication on the network. The security and working practise of peer-to-peer networking are if a PC is connected to a peer based network then there is the chance that another PC on the home network will access files that the owner might not want to be accessed. Althought his might be the case Windows provides the ability to block access to certain drives. peer-to-peer based networks are perfect for group work or businesses where everyones work needs to be shared or ideas need to be shared around. In a business environment when projects need to have alot of work put into them and there is not time to email and exchnage information; it is more effective for the project and the business if members of the business can access any information needed within seconds. This can improve a businesses productivity and effectiveness. Collaboration within peer-to-peer works in a way which can get everyone involved. There are a few programs that offer peer-to-peer collaboration. For example when colaborating it will start off with a Peer determining the identiity of a peer who is interested in hosting a collaboration session. Next a request to host a session is sent and the host peer agrees to manage collaboration activity. The host will then invite contacts to a session which includes the requestor. The host peer may add remote peers to its contact manager. It also looks at all invitations sent and recieved, to see who has accepted, declined or just not answered. It may cancel invitations for those who have not answered. Now everyone is in and ready the host can start the collaboration session of  the game, bulletpin board, conference or other activity.

### Client server
This is a computer network where there is one main/centralized which is connected to a hub to which many less powerful/important computers/systems are connected called clients, the clients will run progrms and access data that has previously been stored on the server (the main computer). A few advantages of using Client server networks is the fact you have a lot of scalability as you can increase the capacity of clients and servers; any elements can be increased. Communications within A Client server network is different compared to a peer-to-peer network as unlike the peer-to-peer network instead of every computer interacting with each other, the clients (computers) will send requests to the server (main PC), the server will handle them by either completing the request or not completing it, then finally the server will send back the information. Additionally, another communication method within Client server is the RPC which stands for Remote Procedure calls which is a high level communication method, and it was designed to mimic procedure call mechanism but executing it over a network. The working practise for Client server can be seen as the fact the security of the using the Client server network is a lot higher than say peer-to-peer networking because within Client server networking there is one main server (PC) that controls and has more power over every other node (computer). the commercial opportunity/use of Client server networking can be used within a business where there are lots of emplyees using lots of computers. For example within most companies they will have a tech administrator depending on the size of the business This administrator will supervise the whole businesses computer throughout the day and control block, allow and deny what the employees can access and not access. Of course the administrator will have the server computer with the most power, where the employees with be the ones that dont have much control over access and things of this variety. Additionally, with this we come to information sharing which the administrator can also help to keep under wraps. If there are certain documents the CEOs or managers dont want getting out the administrator will make sure he and the other higher members of the companies are the only ones that can access these documents. As well as this he can help encrypt personal documents and files from other co-workers that they do not want to give anyone access too, this also relates to passwords for the employees and trying to reduce hackings. Finally, when collaborating, the administrator is able to control everyones computer to set up the collaborating activity securely and quickly. If the administrator does it invidivually  this can be seen as ineffective as it make take longer than if he were to give everyone a password and a username to connect to a server on their nodes. Althought it may seem ineffective for the administrator to do it one node at a time, this will make sure it is set up correctly and securely. If not the administrator will allow the nodes to connect to his server individually by giving them a password, username and so on.

### Cloud
A cloud in computing terms is the storing and accessing of data and programs over/within the internet instead of your typical hard drive. Cloud has nothing to do with your hard drive, when data is stored on your hard drive that is referred to as local storage. Everything you need for local storage is physically infront of you, making data accessing fast and easy to do. Additionally, the cloud is not about having a dedicated NAS hardware, (network attached storage) or a server on the residence. For computing to be classed as cloud computing you will need to access your programs, data or information over the internet or at the very least have that data synced with over forms of data over the internet. As cloud computing is done over the internet is can be done anywhere anytime, as long as you have a stable internet connection. Also using the cloud for business is a great way to save money as you do not need to fork out on huge expensive hardware for your premises, all you need is an internet connection and all your data can be accessed. You can access as many resources and you need, pretty much instantly and all you need to pay for is what you use, which is a huge plus for businesses as you waste nothing. A few advantages of Cloud based computing would be firstly as I mentioned earlier it is a lot cheaper than hardware based computing, as all you need is an internet connection and a computer, you dont need to buy expensive hardware, server and systems. Secondly, when it comes to hardware computing you either have to many servers and not enough people using them or not enough servers and too many people trying to use the few you have at one time. With cloud based computing you never have too many or too little just buy/order as many as you need and if you need anymore during a session or at any point, or have to many than you need, you can cancel any server or add a server at a moments notice. Lastly, it has never been easy to go global. With hardware computing it can be frustrating having to send data, or holding that data on a memory stick, and if you lose that memory stick, all your data gets lost with it; but with cloud based computing all your data is stored online so you can access it anywhere anytime and you can send it to anyone around the world almost instantly, this means you can provide your service in multiple regions, while keeping a lower latency to all your customers. As you may know the cloud is transforming the workplace and its work practise, businesses are ever evolving with technology and the cloud is helping businesses save money and become more efficent. When we talk about the CLoud and the commercial oppotunity of it we can speak about cost. If a business is using the cloud they dont need to buy huge expensive hardware, this being said someone who just uses the Cloud will be saving a lot of money and of course within a business saving money is important. Within the cloud you can send emails to one another with the know how it will get there secure and uninterupted; additionally, you can send information to anyone world wide at the click of a finger. That includes if they are the cloud them selves or using plain old hardware. Lastly, the collaboration within the Clous is easy. Anyone connected to the Cloud can share information with each other and collaborate as well. This can come in the form of connecting/collaborating to play or game or just simply sending an email. All of this is as secure as hardware computing, and some would say even more secure as you can not physically hold the Cloud holding all of your data, unlike hardware computing.

### Cluster 
This form of computing is easy to understand and even use, cluster computing is when a party of computers are joint/linked together to act like one entity/computer. This form of computing in simple terms is when two or more computers come together, most commonly through a local network in order to use the processing power of all of the computers at once. There are three main types of computer clusters, firstly we have High availability clusters which in essence are a group of computers that are used to support server apps that can be reliably utilized, and are normally used to maintain redundant nodes that act as backup systems. Secondly, low balancing clusters is a networking methodology which distributes workloads across multiple computers or on computer clusters. It works by passing all work through one or more load-balancing nodes, which then distribute the workload between the remaining active nodes efficently. Lastly, we have the high-performance cluster the way a high-performance cluster works is using supercomputers and computers clusters to solve difficult computation problems. A HPC cluster is used and designed to exploit the processing power of all two or more nodes. A few advantages of cluster computing is, firstly is that cluster computing reduces the cost of processing power. Lastly, it has lots of system availability as using cluster computing offers a high system availability because of the redundency of OS (operating systems) and hardware. When it comes to communications, information sharing and collaborations; as each computer is connected with one another every piece of information can be shared with the click of a mouse, and each computer can talk to another with again the click of a mouse. Additionally, when collaborating for example through a high availability cluster each system is fully connected and are being used to support server apps, this is done by connecting a group of computers to act like one big computer, it is used to support server apps because of the high power all of the computers combined have. Along with this high availability clusters can be used within businesses to support their server apps which can be very convenient as it does not take a lot of resources to set up a part from several computers, which in the long run will reduce the cost of processing power. The working practise of a business can be changed completely when it comes to cluster computing as you do not need huge hardware with a huge amount of processing power to support servers all you need is a few computers that are all connected which most offices already have.

### Centralized 
This type of computing is where most if not all of the processing is done by one central server/computer. This computing enables the use of the central computers computing administration, resources and management, in essence the main computer is used/responsible for delivering app logic, processing and providing resources to all of the joint nodes. Similary to client/server computing centralized computing is where one or more client PCs are connect to a central server/computer. Normally, each joint computer has very little processing/computing capacitiy, they will normally have a display, a thin CPU with networking capabilities and some basic input devices. All of these connected PCs computing will be processed by the central computer. The central computer is a high-end server, which available resources such as the primary application, massive computing resources, high amount of storage and other high end computing resources/features. The connected nodes are fully dependent on the central server, for things like app access, computing, storage internet access and the more imporant one security. Lastly, the admin will monitor all client nodes from the central server interface. When collaborating and communicating it all goes through the main server this makes it easy to go about collaborating and communicating because it is all done from one computer; also with information sharing, each piece of information will go through the main pc at some point. It will pass through the main pc and get dropped off onto another. Additionally, the other pc's all rely on the main pc to tell them what to do and how to do it. This is why it is good for commercial use as the admin within an organisation that is using the pc's to store data or to data mine can control each of the computers from the main one with ease.

### Virtualized
This type of computing/network is made up of several segments called channels. These channels hold all available bandwitch within the network, each channel holds the same amount of bandwidth than the next. Each one of these channels act on there own terms and can be assigned/connected to any device that is on the same network as its own at that time. One of the first and easily most important benefit would be the reduced cost of a virtualized network. As this type of network requires less servers and hardware to run it reduces the overall cost spent on hardware, additionally in the long run this will also reduce energy cost. When it comes to information sharing, collaborations and communication as each channel is seperate and act alone they never have to communicate/speak to one another, the only type of collaborating and sharing they do is to the device they are connected too.

### OSI Model
There are several layers within the OSI model. Here are all 7:

Session - This layer is designed to create and manage the connections between applications; depdning on what type of application it is, either TCP od UDP will be used.

Physical - This layer is responsible for sending data through cables. It can send data in the from of electrical pulses, light pulses and bit stream.

Application - This layer is in charge of making sure that a service is provided to ensure efective communication between other application programs on a network. Additionally, within this layer different protocols are assigned to different types of data.

Transport - This layer as its name states is the way that data gets from point a to point b, this layer is in charge of getting it there and working out where certain data is meant to go.

Presentation - Before the data can be sent it must be encrypted or compressed, this is where this layer comes in. This layer is in charge of changing, compressing and encrypting data to suit wherever it is going.

Data link - Like the presentation layer this layer can also be used to encrypt data but this layer can decode the data too, to make it ready to be sent off to other layers.

Network - This layer makes sure each piece of data being sent will have the correct informtaion it needs to get to where its meant to be. Where travelling from node to node this layer will also create virtual circuits to help with the transmitting of data.

### TCP/IP Model
Application - This layer is used to assign the correct protocol to the correct type of data. Additionally, is is used to provide network services to applications. The network processes and protocols that are used within this layer are: Simple mail transport protocol (SMTP), File transfer protocol (FTP) and finally Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).

Transport - This layer is used to create and manage the communication between the reciever and the sender. There are two main protocols which are used in the running of this layer. One being UDP and the other TCP. UPD does not check if the data has been sent or recieved, it just send the data and hopes for thes best. Whereas within TCP there is a set system that checks to see if the reciever has recevied the data.

Internet - This layer will contain the packet construct that will be sent/transmitted. Additionally, it will organize the data into packets before it is sent off. To make sure the correct reciever recieves the correct packet the recievers IP address is used to pin point exactly where it should be transmitted.

Network access - This layer is in charge of interfacing with your networks's architecture. A few protocols carried out within this layer are mapping IP addresses to physical hardware addresses (MAC addresses), the encapsulation of the IP packets into frames for their  transportation and the use of protocols for the transmission of the data. This layer will also check the data that has been sent or recieved to see if it contains any errors.

### Working standards and protocols
#### IEEE 802.3
In general 802.3 refers to the physical media and the working characteristics of Ethernet. Most commonly it is used in LAN connections and its communication standards are updated and added to regularly. Additionally, these standards are put forth by the Institute of electrical and Electronics Engineers, which is what the IEEE stands for. It defines the physical layer and the media access control (MAC) of the data link layer, normally for wired Ethernet networks and as I mentioned earlier is it generally used as a local network (LAN). Lastly, the 802.3 standard refers to the networking characteristics of an Ethernet. For example how physical connections between other nodes happen through several media, like coaxial and fiber cable.

#### IEEE 802.7
This standard identifies the recommended practices that should be used when using a broadband LAN. Additionally, this standard specifies the installation, design and parameters that should be used when going about a broadband cable medium. Lastly, it also mentions what type of methods should be used when it comes to testing the connection.

#### IEEE 802.8
This standard contains guidelines on how to use fiber optics within a network. Also including Fiber distributed data Interface (FDDI) and ethernet over fiber-optic cable guidelines. Also it gives reccomendations of how to go about testing fibre optic LAN and metropolitan area networks. 

#### IEEE 802.11 
These set of standards define the communication for wireless LANs. Along from this it is a set of guidelines for setting up and implementing Wi-Fi.

### Routed Protocols
Routed protocols give out routing information to all of the routers on a network. It describes how different protocols govern how data is passed on from one device to another. If all routers are connected to a network each router can decide which is the best path to take to deliver your traffic. A few examples of routing protocols are Border gateway protocol (BGP), Routing information protocol (RIP), Enhanced interior gatewate routing protocol (EIGRP) and Open shortest path first (OSPF). There have been many protocols that have either failed or could not be recovered from an error. One protocol was IPv4 which contained around 4 billion possible IP addresses but as time went on and technology became more popular we started to run out, and this is when IPv6 had to take IPv4's place. IPv6 contained a possible 340 undecillion IP addresses which in theory is a lot but because of the rising use of technology we still may one day run out.

Examples of some protocols:

IPv4 - Fourth internet protocol which contained 4 billion IP addresses, thought to be enough but was too not enough.

IPv6 - Sixth internet protocol which contained 340 undecillion IP addresses which is a huge amount of addresses. Which people still think will run out some day. This protocol replaced IPv6.

Multicast address - Is a single address which is used for a set of hosts that are all joined in a multicasting group.

Global unicast - Is a feature within the IPv6 protocol which allows a public router to use a single node, on the internet or public domain.

Unique local - This is an address which is also used within the IPv6 protocol as an identifier.

Auto configuration - Automatic configuration of devices 

Link local - This is an IPv6 unicast address that can be automatically configured 

### Service and Network protocols.

SSL:

Secure sockets layer is used to help keep data that is on the internet secure. One way it does this is by encrypting different types of data. A few examples of data that it protects, is addresses, credit card details, passwords, tax forms and large website changes.

SMTP:

Simple mail transfer protocol is a protocol used when sending and receiving emails. 

FTP:

When it comes to TCP/IP connections the File transfer protocol (FTP) is used to transfer data/files from one computer to another over the internet.

HTTP: 

This is one you may have seen a few times in the top left of URLs and it is used to define how messages are transmitted and formatted over the internet. It stands for Hypertext transfer protocol.

POP3:

This protocol works together with the SMTP protocol. The Post office protocol 3 (POP3) is used to recieve emails, then these emails are held by your internet server.

### The impact of networking topology, communication and bandwidth

Here are a few examples of Topologies:

Logical topologies are an arrangement of devices on a computer network that show how each one communicate with one another. A couple examples of logical topologies are:

Ring: Within this topology only one of the nodes can transfer data in the network at one time. Which means collision of data is avoided.

Bus: This topology is used by Ethernet to pass data. A node will broadcast the data to the network, and every node will check to see if the data is for them.

Physical topolgies are a interconnected structure of a LAN, the method used to connect the devices to the network and the method to decide what type of cables to use when connecting the devices all complete the physical topology. A few examples of physical topologies are:

The linear Bus topology: This topology is a single cable that contains terminators at each end to prevent any loss of signal with the nodes that are directly connected with one another.

The Star topology: This topology has a single access point/switch that all nodes are directly connected to.

Tree topology: This topology is a combination of both of the previous topologies. Within this topology there are multiple access points that are connected to the single cable within the Bus topology. Additionally, the nodes are connected to the access points that they belong to.

Mesh Topology: This topology is the idea of having several connections between each machine to give it more one than possible route, in case one route is unusable.

Communication 

Communication in computing terms is referring to the sending and receiving of data between two or more machines. One of the most common forms of communcation between two or more machines is the process of requesting data from the server. This can come in many forms such as requesting access to your emails from the server or requesting data from a website from the web server. Additionally, while connected to the interent data is being sent to and from you machine all the time. Within a network the router is the main machine that will direct traffic to its correct destination. With the amount of data thjat is being sent and requested, there are going to be people that want to access this data; and to do this they will need to initiate an attack. This can be done by attacking the data while it is in transit. One way to prevent that is putting up a firewall which will stop certain data from passing through it; because security measures like a firewall need to be put in place to make communication more secure, the speed of data communication can be slowed down. Additionally, within a firewall it can prevent the data reaching its destination full stop, when it flags data that is of no harm to the machine.

### Operating principles (glossary)

#### Hubs 
Hubs are used as connection points for networks, they route and manage traffic over the local connections. This means all users dont get a copy but it alos slows down the system as a whole.

#### Routers
Routers connect multiple local networks. Each packet of data that is sent to the router will have an address attached to it, with this information the router will know where to send it and which route is the best for it to take.

#### Switches 
A switch is similar to a hub in the sense that it takes and routes data to the machines connected to a LAN but instead of sending one piece of data at a time it send a copy of the data to every machine on the network, this speeds up the system but can be an easy way for a hacker to infiltrate several computers at once.

#### Multilayer switches
A multilayer switch is similar to a switch but can perform more efficently and faster because of its added features of a router.

#### Firewall
A firewall is a device that is usually placed as the gateway device to another network and it looks at all traffic coming in and out of the network and allows and disallows certain types of traffic depending on the rules regarding the use of that network.

#### HIDS
A HIDS which stands for Host-based intrusion detection system, is a system that like a firewall looks at data but instead of waiting for the data to pass through it, it will search for any abnormalities within the packet or within the internals of the computer, to make sure nothing that could cause harm is allowed in.

#### Repeaters
A repeater is a device that is used within a network to increase the strength of a signal that is being sent over a big distance on a physical LAN, this is good as it can increase the size of the LAN itself.

#### Bridges
A bridge is used to connect a network to another network that is using a bridge, but they can only connect if they are using the same protocols if not they it can cause connection problems, because bridges use an internal database to determine what types of trafic is allowed in or out of that network.

#### Wireless device
A wireless device is a device that does not need to be physically wired to the network to be able to connect to it.
 
#### Access point
An access point is a way of a user connecting to a network while they are not physically connect to that network. A common access point is a wireless access point as it uses Wi-Fi to allow the user to connect to the network remotely.

#### Content filter
A content filter uses a pre determined set of rules that is can use to compare to any incomming piece of data. It is used to check if any of the incomming data is malicious or spam. A lot of email apps and servers use this to filter out all of the spam emails that are trying to invade people emails.

#### Load Balancer
A load balancer is a simple idea but very effective. Its role it so spread out the workload/traffic to prevent congestion and to prevent any thing slowly down because it has to much traffic.

#### Modem
This is used to connect networks using the existing telephone lines in the area, while this is good as it can reach remote areas its speed is not very high. Additionally, it is used to convert digital and analog signals.

#### Packet shaper
A packet shaper is a device that sits in between the internal network and external network, it is used to prioritize certain piece of data that is being sent over a network using pre defined rules. If slowls down things like messages to allow things like security information to pass through faster.

#### VPN concentrator
A VPN concentrator main job is to allow multiple users to use the same VPN (as long as they are on the same network). The way it does this is by co-ordinating and organising traffic on a network between the machines that are trying to acces the VPN.

#### Web
A web server in simple terms stores and sends data on websites over the internet. A user will request to the web server see a website or a piece of data, then web server will handle this request by sending back/displaying the information that the user has requested, also thousands of requests can be completed at once.

#### File
A file server is a server that is used to hold and store data/files for users on a network from them to access. This file/data can be accessed by anyone unless it has been made private then only the user that has made it private can access it.

#### Database
A database is a server that stores data in categories or fields. These fields and categories are all related to one another and so all of the same type of data is in one place. An example of a database server in everyday life, is when at a supermarket when an item is scanned, the device will look through the database and pull up any information relating to that item.

#### Combination
A combination server can combined all the functions of the other servers but in one place and on one server, a few examples of the servers it can incorporate are database, web and file.

#### Virtual
A virtual server is a server that has the functionality of a physical server but is nothing more than a small system that is loaded with special software. Its software helps it perform that tasks that are needed of it by the server.

#### Terminal services server
This server will give other computers that are connected to the other devices with a pth to connect to another LAN or WAN. Unlike most the computers do not need to be connected to a router or even a switch to make the connection.

### Workstation software and hardware
Here are some examples and definitions on what is needed to create a network:

#### Client software
This is a piece of software that works with and within LANs and WANs, they also act as an interface betweenthe user's/client's computer and the server that is on its network. In simple terms it is a piece of software that performs any type of task on the user's/clients machine.

#### Server software
Certain software is installed/added to a server to make sure that server can do a specific task. The type of software a server has will decide what type of server it is. There are a few tasks a serevr can perform and they range from file transfer all the way to web hosting.

#### Client operating system
The operating system also knows as the OS works within the client's computer to allow it to operate on its own. An example of something it allows the user to do is to web browse. An operating system allows the client to use the computer as efficently as possible, additionally it provides the user with a detailed and extensive user interface (UI). Two of the most common client operating systems  would be Windows or Mac.

#### Server operating system
The server operating system is similar to the client operating system but instead of it being on a computer the OS is on a server, and it includes server features to help the server run efficently and effectively. A few things a server might have to do that the OS would help with would be communicating with a device or managing files.

#### Firewall 
Within a server a firewall will have a set of rules it will follow to allow or disallow certain types of data to enter or leave the server. An example of a piece of data it would refuse entry would be any type of virus as well as anything that might be deemed as malicious. A firewall reduces the risk of anything getting in or out of the server that could harm a system, another server or device.

#### Proxies
A proxy server is a server that handles web requests for users that are connected to that server. Normally the user's request would be sent straight to the web server, but in this case it is sent to the proxy server which then checks the request to see if it contains any malicious data or anything that might have been banned on the network already. This adds a level of security to prevent anything from damaging the network or server.

### Network and cabling

#### Network comparision
A network card is a piece of hardware that will allow any computer to connect to a network. The card will allow the computer to communicate and exchange data with the network and is a very useful tool to use when trying to connect to the internet. Additionally, the card will be connected to the network via cables. On the other hand we have the wireless connection option which allows a computer to connect to the network without any physical cabling. This means the network can be accessed by the computer via Wi-Fi which is a form of wireless network, which uses radio waves that are sent at certain frequencies to send/transmit data. Lastly, we have the mobile network which is where a network is distributed over an area using cell towers. The main difference between all three is how they go about connecting and transmitting data. 

#### Cabling
We use cabling to connect devices, computers and hardware together to aid in the process of transmitting data. Cabling connections can only be used if the distance between the two devices are small enough that a cable can reach from one to the other. Thats where wireless connections have an advantage over cabling as wireless connections can cover huge areas.

##### Patch cabling
Patch cables are most commonly used to connect devices to switches, hubs and routers within a network, and are used to connect home networks and business networks as their limit is small.

##### Shielded cabling
These cables are similar to patch but they contain a type of shielding that increase the signals strenght over long distances, which also protects againsts any interferences.

##### Twisted pair cables
These cables are very simple and are two copper wire cables twisted onto one another to create one wire. This decreases the chance of signal loss.

#### Permissions
As the name suggests permissions are used to stop certain people from accessing data they shouldnt. Permissions are set up to make sure only people that are meant to have access to certain data. There are two main types if permissions. The first being New technology file system, which is a file system that is installed onto Window machines and users can set up for example a read only file which means they can add permissions to this file so that only users they want to be able to edit that file can and others cannot. The other type of permission being a shared permission which can be set up for multiple users, and are setb rules that the group has to follow when trying to access files on the network.

#### Workstation
These computers are designed to contain special components to help them perform better on certain tasks than say a normal computer would. The most common characteristic of a workstation would be clocking the CPU to increase its speed drastically. Another common characteristic of a workstation would be its huge ram size which in some cases can be as high as 128GB, these to characteristics provide the workstation with the necessary power it needs to perform certain tasks better than most computers.

#### System bus
In simple terms a system bus is a group of internal connections that connect of the individual components of a computer together, and allow them to exhange or communicate with one another. These connections are essential in an efficent working computer because if not the ram may have recieved a task but as it is not connected to the CPU the CPU is not aware a task needs to be completed. A system bus address is used to share the memory of all the components within the computer, it is used to make sure that all of the components are working together as one.

### Design and implement a network
We had to design a network that consisted of 2 LANs that were connect via two routers. Each LAN had to have 3 computers and 1 server which all conncted to a switch, that then connect to a router. Both these networks had to work with each other so that we were able to send packets of data from one network to the other, or from one device to another. Here is my design concept I used for my networks:

#### Evalutaing and testing my design

As you can see from my design concept I created two LANs which were connected using two routers, which were both connected to a switch, which both had 3 computers within it and both had their own server, and as you can see from the design i chose to use the star topology. Overall, I feel as it was a successful design as it covered all of the requirements while laying it out in an easy to read, professional manner.

Here are the IP addresses I used within my networks:

Simpsons network:

Computer 1 - 192.168.1.100
Computer 2 - 192.168.1.101
Computer 3 - 192.168.1.102
Server - 192.168.1.10
Router - 192.168.1.1

Family guy network: 
Computer 1 - 192.168.10.100
Computer 2 - 192.168.10.101
Computer 3 - 192.168.10.102
Server - 192.168.10.10
Router - 192.168.10.1

##### User feedback
I asked a few of my college peers to give their opinions on my design based off the requirements and here are the verdicts:

Dan said: 'I feel the design meets the requirements and would say that you are ready to start actually making the networks'

Mark said: 'In my opinion it meets the requirements but it would be good if you added a printer into the mix'

Both seemed to like my design but Mark seemed to think it would be a good idea to add a printer to my network. While I agree with what he is saying, a printer was not in the requirements.

As I had already designed the network and look over my feedback I alreadly knew exactly what I needed to do when making my networks. This is a finished screeshot of my networks and I couldnt be more pleased. As I went through creating my networks I created a tick list to make sure I was completing everything before moving onto something else this helped me make sure I covered all of the requirements. As an added bonus I went ahead an added names to each network and computers to give my networks a unique touch. As you can see from the picture the left network is called Springfield (where Simpsons is set) and the computers are named after characters from the Simpsons. Whereas the right network is called Quahog (where Family guy is set) and the computers are named after the characters from Family guy. Lastly, I added lable to my networks to make sure it was easy to read and I did not need to click on each computer to show each ones IP address.

### Testing my network
I needed to test aspects of my networks to make sure it fully worked and that it met the requirements. My test plan shows the amount of tests I did, a description of the test, what I expected to happen when I tested it and finally what actually happened when I tested it. For example I tested to see if I could ping PCs using IP addresses and if I could ping PCs using their display names and as you can see from the test I was succesffuly able to ping PCs either using their IP address or their display name. I am happy with my test results as it showed my networks both worked well and effectively.

### Evalutaion
Overall, I feel this project was a success. I feel this was because the requirements were to design a network that consisted of 2 LANs that were connect via two routers. Each LAN had to have 3 computers and 1 server which all conncted to a switch, that then connect to a router. Both these networks had to work with each other so that we were able to send packets of data from one network to the other, or from one device to another. As you can see from my test result, my design and my finished network I met every requirement and even added more such as lables and names for each computer and network. If I were to come back and re-do this project there are a few things I would do differentlyor things I would add. Firstly, I would like to add a printer or access point to my networks as this would make my networks stand out and provide my computers within my network to connect to the network without physically being connect to the network. Additionally, I would like to have more computers within my networks as I would like the challenge of trying to get them all to connect, Lastly, I would like to add fibre-optic connections as it would increase the speed of my networks making them perform better.
